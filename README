Compiling and testing on Linux
------------------------------

liblwm2m uses CMake.

In the any directory, run the following commands:
    cmake [liblwm2m directory]/client
    make
    ./lwm2mclient
    
The lwm2m opens udp port 5683. You can connect to it by installing the firefox plugin Copper
(http://people.inf.ethz.ch/mkovatsc/copper.php) and opening a new Firefox tab to: coap://[::1]:5683
